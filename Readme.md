WinPenguins is a Win32 rewrite of the X-Windows application XPenguins. It creates cute little penguins that wander around your Windows desktop. The penguin images were taken from Pingus, a lemmings clone for GNU/Linux.

WinPenguins was written by Michael Vines. This is just a fork with minor changes like the proper XP style theming and the newer compiler used.

It doesn't work on Windows 64-bit. If anyone knows how to fix this let me know.
